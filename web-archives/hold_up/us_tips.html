You need to check the transactions that are on the statement and on the list.<BR>																To make it easier, create a filter that displays only unchecked transactions:<BR>								<BR>																1) &quot;File&quot; menu -&gt; &quot;New filter...&quot;<BR>																2) In the &quot;General&quot; pane, choose the target account.<BR>																3) In the &quot;Criteria&quot; pane, check &quot;Checkmarks&quot;, uncheck &quot;Checked&quot;, and make sure &quot;Expense&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot; are half-checked (horizontal line in the checkbox).<BR>																4) Click on &quot;OK&quot;.<BR>								<BR>																You now see only the unchecked transactions in the list. When you check one of them, it disappears from the list!<BR>								<BR>								You may improve this method if you combine it with this other tip: re-edit the filter by double-clicking on its name and in the &quot;Criteria&quot; pane, check &quot;Date&quot; and select &quot;Only previous month&quot; (usually, you should receive your account statement at the beginning of the next month). This filter will now only display unchecked transactions that belong to the previous month.						</UL>					</FONT></P>					<HR>					<P><A name=Anchor-2></A><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Helvetica size=1 color=#555555><B>Analyze the transaction distribution in time.</B><BR>							<UL>								When you select an account or a filter in the Hold-Up window, or when you edit the find text, previously selected transactions will remain selected provided they are still visible. This feature allows you to analyse the distribution of given transactions along the time.<BR>												<BR>For example, if you want to see the repartition of your incomes, create a filter that displays only the income transactions (or if you have assigned a unique category to all your incomes, just enter the name of this category in the find field) and select all the displayed transactions. Then do the reverse operation: select again the previous account or filter, or clear the find field.<BR>												You can now clearly see where are your incomes in the complete transaction list.							</UL>						</FONT></P>					<HR>					<P><A name=Anchor-3></A><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Helvetica size=1 color=#555555><B>Display the transactions of several accounts at the same time.</B><BR>							<UL>								Let's say you're managing several accounts with Hold-Up and you'd like to see the list of all the transactions of all the accounts. It's very easy thanks to the filters:<BR>												<BR>1) &quot;File&quot; menu -&gt; &quot;Create new filter...&quot;<BR>2) Click on &quot;OK&quot;.<BR>												<BR>You've just created a filter that does strictly nothing: it simply displays all transactions from all Hold-Up accounts.								</UL>						</FONT></P>					<HR>					<P><A name=Anchor-4></A><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Helvetica size=1 color=#555555><B>Simplify the transaction list display when the account has lots of transactions.</B><BR>							<UL>								If there are lots of transactions on your account, it may be fastidious to always see them all in the list while most of the time, you only need to see the last ones.<BR>Help yourself, by creating a filter that displays only transactions from the current month:<BR>												<BR>1) &quot;File&quot; menu -&gt; &quot;New filter...&quot;<BR>2) In the &quot;General&quot; pane, choose the target account.<BR>3) In the &quot;Criteria&quot; pane, check &quot;Date&quot; and select &quot;Only this month&quot;.<BR>4) Click on &quot;OK&quot;.<BR>												<BR>You now only see the transactions from the current month in the list!							</UL>						</FONT></P>					<HR>					<P><A name=Anchor-5></A><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Helvetica size=1 color=#555555><B>Use the information area below the transaction list.</B><BR>							<UL>								A line of text is located below the transaction list that indicates the number of displayed transactions and their sum. This feature used in combination with the filters or the find field is very useful to do quick computations:<BR>												<BR>For example, let's say you want to know how much you have pay on your credit card: provided you have put these transaction in the &quot;Credit card&quot; category, you just need to type &quot;Credit card&quot; in the find field to display only the transactions paid by credit card and their total amount.							</UL>						</FONT></P>					<HR>					<P><A name=Anchor-6></A><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Helvetica size=1 color=#555555><B>Simplify the display of your account.</B><BR>							<UL>								To avoid that your account contains too many transactions and becomes unreadable, we suggest you to create a new account each year and with an opening balance equal the balance of last year. Then use the tip &quot;<A href="#Anchor-3">Display the transactions of several accounts at the same time.</A>&quot; to go back to the previous display.							</UL>						</FONT></P>				</TD>			</TR>		</TABLE>	</BODY></HTML>
