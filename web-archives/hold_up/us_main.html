It appeared that several bugs specific to Hold-Up 1.7 were not detected during beta-testing. Actually, Hold-Up 1.7 was a big step from 1.6 with lots and lots of source code changes, and it was difficult to re-test all Hold-Up functionalities.<BR>
As said before, Hold-Up 1.7 is the last 1.x version. However, Hold-Up's customers cannot be left with a version that contains bugs - until 2.0 comes out. So here's a &quot;bug fixes&quot; version. It still has a few new features though:
<UL>
<LI>Optimized sorting algorithms.
<LI>Changing the state of the reconciled box or the warning box of a transaction, directly in the transaction list of a filter, no more refreshes the filter immediately.
</UL>
It fixes the following bugs:
<UL>
<LI>Fixed a bug that could crash the program when the transaction list has only one item.
<LI>Fixed a bug when deleting expired scheduled transactions.
<LI>Fixed printing margins not being saved correctly on a metric system.
<LI>Fixed incorrect calculation of number of pages to print in certain circumstances.
<LI>Fixed incorrect alphabetical sorting.
<LI>Fixed a bug when adding operations to an empty account could crash.
<LI>Fixed incorrect transaction list subsorting.
<LI>Fixed a bug regarding the scrollbar thumb positionning.
<LI>Fixed a bug that could crash the program when drawing the transaction list.
</UL>
