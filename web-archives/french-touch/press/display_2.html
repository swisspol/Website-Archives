Mastering the different ships and levels is an extraordinary challenge. <BR>The beauty and the diversity of the circuits located in different parts of the world, and the incredible soundtrack create a thrilling atmosphere.<BR><BR><BR><BR>_______________________________________________________________________<BR><BR>Major steps have been accomplished between this summer and now:<BR><BR><BR>A lot of new features requested by the visitors of the Apple Expo Paris and our Beta-Testers Team were added. <BR><BR>Moreover, we have completed the outstanding artificial intelligence, which will lead computer opponents through the beautiful landscapes. It is a really challenging AI, that players will not defeat from the beginning on. In WaterRace, the AI is divided into &quot;bots&quot; (one per ship) and each bot has its own &quot;virtual input device&quot; to control the ship. Therefore, the AI is behaving exactly as normal human players do and cannot cheat!<BR><BR>Many new animated characters and wildlife have been added in the environments. The level designers worked a lot to create a complete world for each location, with a special atmosphere, unique 3D models, lighting effects, animations and ambient sounds.<BR><BR>We've spent a huge amount of time tuning the very detailed physic engine of the game to make sure each ship had a unique behavior and all the ships were well balanced regarding performances.<BR><BR>The 3D engine has also been improved and now fully supports almost every 3D video card on the Mac from the ATI Rage II to the ATI Radeon and the 3Dfx Voodoo 5500 (provided you have the latest drivers of course).<BR><BR>A very important point about WaterRace is its ability to run correctly on a lot of Macs contrary to most games that will be out for Christmas: it requires a G3 with 6Mb of VRAM and that's it! It needs only 14Mb of memory and 100Mb free space on the hard disk. Consequently, it runs beautifully on almost all iMacs (even some Rev. A), iBooks and PowerBooks!<BR><BR><BR><BR>_______________________________________________________________________<BR><BR>Actually, we've been working so much on the game to have it ready on time and as much perfect as possible that we went silent for almost 3 months!<BR>But now it's time for some big news!<BR><BR><BR>1) We announced this summer that WaterRace would be released this fall. Well, we did it: WaterRace is Golden Master and was sent to production this week! We expect to release it officially early December.<BR><BR><BR>2) You can pre-order WaterRace starting today and until the CDs come out of productions. So it's a very limited time offer!<BR>The price is US $27 ONLY!!! (add $5 international S&amp;H)<BR>The normal price will be US $34 (add $5 international S&amp;H) so by pre-ordering the game, you can save 18% of the normal price!<BR><BR>WaterRace is available on CD and contains:<BR>&#149; music in the audio tracks of the CD <BR>&#149; English, French and German versions of WaterRace <BR>&#149; printed users manual in English, French and German <BR><BR>Don't miss this fantastic offer and get WaterRace for Christmas! You can pre-order WaterRace from the WaterRace web site:<BR>http://www.waterrace.com<BR><BR><BR>3) A demo of WaterRace will be released worldwide in a few days (we're currently doing final testing on it).<BR><BR><BR>4) We have completely redesigned the French Touch and WaterRace web site; you need to have a look! There is now a huge amount of info now online regarding WaterRace and there's even more coming!<BR><BR><BR>5) We've released 3 small QuickTime movies that come from the final version of WaterRace. They showcase the stunning action you can experience in this game! It's a must see!<BR><BR><BR>6) A pack of 15 brand new screenshots of the final version of WaterRace are also available on the WaterRace web site.<BR><BR><BR>7) And finally, for WaterRace fans, don't forget to download our latest desktop pictures.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>_______________________________________________________________________<BR><BR>We would like to highlight some particularities of our small game development company and the way WaterRace was created:<BR><BR>WaterRace was developed using Macs only and sometimes SGI stations for 3D modeling, so it's a &quot;real&quot; Mac only game that's completely different from what you'll see on PCs or consoles.<BR><BR>French Touch is a independent team of European game developers with no prior game development experience that was created 2 years ago. It has grown from 5 people at the beginning to 9 nowadays. Members of the team work on game projects unpaid, during their free time and even more complicated, from different locations (Switzerland, France, Spain...). because nobody would ever finance a Mac only game project. So each of us had to manage 2 jobs at the same time to complete the game: one for a living and one for the pleasure.<BR><BR>It's true that there is a bunch of similar teams over the Internet, but it's quite rare that this kind of project eventually ever comes to life, so we're quite happy to have finished WaterRace. Let's hope people will appreciate our work and that it will encourage other similar Mac only developments!<BR><BR><BR>Anyway, the result of our work is finally here, and we hope you will enjoy it as much as we do!<BR><BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR><BR>The French Touch Team<!-- FIN press release -->					</TT></UL>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD bgcolor="#f5f5f5"><TT><!-- DEBUT note -->French Touch is a independent European game developer dedicated to the creation of exclusive 3D games for the Macintosh.
