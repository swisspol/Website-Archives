For<BR>this purpose, French Touch developed an exclusive 100% Rave 3D engine<BR>(Infinity) which is compatible with the ATI 3D chips of the latest Power<BR>Macs G3.<BR><BR>French Touch also developed its own software such as Fusion for example,<BR>which is a unique 3D editing program entirely in real-time dedicated to the<BR>creation of the models for our games &#150; more info is available on the web<BR>site : http://www.french-touch.net/fusion.<BR><BR>French Touch also wishes to create a new type of relationship between the<BR>players and the developers of the game, by on the one hand associating them<BR>actively with the development of the game (thanks to beta-testing), and on<BR>the other hand by placing at their free disposal on the web site the<BR>development tools used for the game such as model and terrain editors.<BR>The players will be able to easily create extensions or additional levels<BR>and we will of course put the best ones for download on the web site of the<BR>game.<BR><BR><BR>The games currently under development at French Touch are:<BR><BR><BR>__________________________________________________________________________<BR>WaterRace<BR>__________________________________________________________________________<BR><BR>For its first realization, French Touch decided to choose a type of arcade<BR>game still unknown in the macintosh gaming world: boat races.<BR>WaterRace is a racing game where the player will be able to face adversaries<BR>either simulated by the computer, or in network play over the Internet.<BR>WaterRace brings in addition many innovations to this concept: full 3D, open<BR>architecture of the game, many &quot;vehicles&quot; and animated terrains...<BR>WaterRace uses a special version of the 3D engine developed by French Touch<BR>which supports special effects like Soft Shadows, Lens Flares...<BR>The open architecture of the program will make it possible for the player to<BR>easily add extension packs: new boats, new terrains, new musics... which he<BR>will find on the Internet site of the game. But the player will also be able<BR>to create by himself extension packs thanks to the development tools created<BR>for the game, that French Touch will put for free download on the web site.<BR>Such features promise an almost unlimited lifetime for the game!<BR>All the terrains will be different not only by their difficulty but also by<BR>their &quot;atmosphere&quot; so... special: lagoon, antartic, boat cemetery...<BR><BR>Our goal: fun, speed, the satisfaction of the player, and of course to prove<BR>that it&#146;s possible to create very good original games for the Mac!<BR><BR>WaterRace will definitely mark the year 99 of the Mac game world.<BR><BR>WaterRace will be distributed on Internet and will be sold as a shareware,<BR>most probably around $25 U.S.<BR>Release date: before summer 99.<BR>For further information relating to WaterRace, to get regularly updated<BR>screen shots as well as the lastest news, connect to the web site of the<BR>game :<BR>http://www.french-touch.net/waterrace<BR><BR><BR><BR>__________________________________________________________________________<BR>Lords of Steel<BR>__________________________________________________________________________<BR><BR>This game is our long time project. Unfortunately, we cannot diffuse yet<BR>much information on this game. All that we can say for the moment, is that,<BR>although it is based on the same 3D engine, Lords of Steel will be radically<BR>different from WaterRace.<BR><BR>Lords of Steel is an adventure game with a complex script which takes place<BR>in a post-feudal futuristic universe where Mechs have replaced the knights.<BR>The sound track is considered as much important as the graphical part of the<BR>game and this will promise a total immersion of the player in the fantastic<BR>world of Lords of Steel.<BR><BR>Due to the required storage, Lords of Steel is intended to be published on<BR>CD-Rom.<BR><BR>No release date has been defined yet and further information will be<BR>available progressively with the advance of the game on the site :<BR>http://www.french-touch.net/lords-of-steel<BR><BR><BR><BR>__________________________________________________________________________<BR><BR>On the web site of French Touch ( http://www.french-touch.net ), you will be<BR>able to read the latest news, to learn more on our projects of games, but<BR>also to read a detailed summary of the history of the creation of French<BR>Touch and a profile of its members.<BR><BR>A press room which includes high-resolution images of the games and logos<BR>(of a printable quality on paper magazines) and the texts of the press<BR>releases, is also accessible from the web site.<BR><BR>For all other information related to French Touch or to the games under<BR>development, do not hesitate to write to us: info@french-touch.net or to<BR>contact directly the person whose name and e-mail are specified below.<BR><BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR><BR>The French Touch Team<!-- FIN press release -->					</TT></UL>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD bgcolor="#f5f5f5"><TT><!-- DEBUT note -->French Touch is a independent European game developer dedicated to the creation of exclusive 3D games for the Macintosh.
