Well, we've been<BR>working the whole August month on the game and it's getting really close to<BR>release now and we took some time to setup a brand new QuickTime trailer in<BR>order to show you our progression. It's time to see this unique high-speed<BR>racing game in action!<BR><BR>Remember our old WaterRace trailer from last year? Well, forget it and<BR>discover the new WaterRace. This trailer showcases the final WaterRace,<BR>which features redesigned ships, redesigned levels, redesigned 3D<BR>characters, improved music and more. It's a whole new game!<BR><BR>Download the trailer from the WaterRace web site:<BR>-&gt; http://www.waterrace.com<BR><BR><BR>You might wonder why we decided to redesign most of the game... well keep in<BR>mind we're not professional game developers and that we're working in our<BR>free time only on WaterRace. The consequence is that we learned a lot during<BR>the first year of development and we eventually realized that most of our<BR>first work was not as perfect as we wished, so we took the risk to start<BR>over on many features. And as this video proves, it worked out!<BR><BR>To answer your upcoming question : we still cannot give you a more accurate<BR>release date than &quot;this fall&quot; since we're still in discussion with<BR>publishers and editors. But keep assured we're really doing our best in<BR>order that WaterRace is out ASAP.<BR><BR><BR>We hope you'll enjoy this trailer - happy downloading !<BR><BR><BR>Best regards,<BR><BR>The French Touch Team<!-- FIN press release -->					</TT></UL>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD bgcolor="#f5f5f5"><TT><!-- DEBUT note -->French Touch is a independent European game developer dedicated to the creation of exclusive 3D games for the Macintosh.
