Persistence is a reliable and flexible online backup solution for Mac OS X Leopard that is compatible with most Internet servers: FTP, FTPS, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, iDisk... (it even supports offline backups to external drives). Persistence is a true Mac product that preserves Finder info, resource forks, ACLs... and comes with an elegant user interface and a powerful assistant. It also provides numerous high-end features like US government approved AES-256 encryption, efficient bz2 compression, powerful exclusion rules and scheduler, support for splitting large files during network transfers, network-error recovery, individual digital signature for backed up files, multi-cores machines optimization and more.

Persistence is the best backup solution for Mac OS X users who already have access to online storage, or who simply want more control than other backup products allow, without having to resort to configuring complex utilities.

Persistence is an innovative and robust online & offline backup software for Mac OS X Leopard. Use it to backup your essential data to servers on the Internet, external drives or USB keys.

Some key Persistence features:

* Provides an intuitive user interface and also includes a powerful assistant to help the user setting up new backups.

* Built from the ground up to reliably backup large data sets (hundreds of gigabytes and dozens of thousands of files), as well as to be robust in case of network errors or even interrupted backups.

* Fully preserves file metadata: creation and modification dates, Finder info (e.g. label or Spotlight comments), UNIX permissions, ACLs, extended attributes...

* Computes digital signatures every file being backed up so that its integrity can be verified when you restore it. Digital signatures are also computed for every generated backup data file to ensure the data at the backup destination hasn't been corrupted.

* Optionally protect the privacy of your data with modern AES-256 encryption (approved by the US Government to protect classified information).

* Supports offline backups to external drives or USB keys, and is compatible with most online servers: WebDAV (over HTTP or HTTPS), AFP, SMB, FTP, FTPS, SFTP, Amazon S3 (over HTTP or HTTPS) or even Apple iDisk.

* Provides advanced exclusion rules and scheduler settings, bzip2 data compression, automatic grouping or splitting of files in segments of a given maximum size, pre & post-backup custom executables... and is even optimized for multi-cores Macs!
