						<P><TT><I>Snap it! is the definitive screen capture tool for MacOS.</I><BR>
						<BR>
						Contrary to other screen capture tools available, Snap It! is a very low-level screen hacker: Snap It! can take a picture of every part of the screen absolutely whenever you want and save the result in a standard PICT file.<BR>
						And most of all, Snap It! is <B>freeware</B>!<BR>
						<BR>
						No more troubles in taking screenshots of programs like games which do not give processing time to the Finder or to the classical screen capture programs and prevent them from capturing the screen content.<BR>
						<BR>
						Snap It! can capture in any bitdepth and in any size provided enough memory is available.<BR>
						<BR>
						If you can see it on screen, then Snap It! can capture it!<BR>

						<P><TT><I>D-Fusion is a stand alone player for Fusion object files.</I><BR>
						<BR>
						It is less than 150Kb but includes both the Infinity 3D Rave Engine and the Fusion sequencer allowing you to play full screen the animations contained in Fusion object files by just dropping the object file onto D-Fusion's icon or double-clicking onto the D-Fusion's icon.<BR>
						And most of all, D-Fusion is <B>freeware</B>!<BR>
						<BR>
						You can directly use the Fusion object files in D-Fusion: no conversion process is required.<BR>
						<BR>
						Create awesome 3D real-time animation using Fusion, then just distribute them over the Internet with the D-Fusion player!<BR>

						<P><TT><I>Chronos is the first high-quality real-time 3D screen saver for the Mac.<BR>
						</I><BR>
						Anybody knows that screen savers are not really useful, but they are nice. What about a new generation of screen savers?<BR>
						You're tired of seeing always the same flat 2D screen saver? You've got a brand new G3 and want a screen saver that use the power of the new Rage 128? What about having cool animations that will blow your PC friends still using the Windoze standard screen saver with that jerky 3D text animation?<BR>
						<BR>
						The answer is Chronos: Chronos is the only real-time 3D screen saver with awesome performances for the Mac. All you need is a PowerMac with 3D acceleration.<BR>
						<BR>
						And most of all, Chronos is <B>freeware</B>!<BR>

					<UL>
						<P><TT><I>Fusion is a powerful 3D editor developed by French Touch in order to create the 3D models to be used in their games.<BR>
						</I><BR>
						Fusion 2.5 is a must-have update of Fusion: improved interface, improved caracter animation, and rotoscoping are among the new features.<BR>
						<BR>
						Fusion was developed totally from the ground up as a real-time editor and is based on the Infinity 3D Rave engine; this makes it the fastest 3D tool available on the Mac plateform even on low end PowerMacs.<BR>
						<BR>
						Fusion can import the meshes contained in 3DMF files, modify them (position, rotation, scale...), add colors or textures, and save the result in a specific file format, which may be directly use in our games.<BR>
						Fusion also offers powerful features like: linking, a sequencer to animate the objects, a vertex per vertex texture mapping editor, rotoscoping, multiple texture sets, cameras...<BR>
