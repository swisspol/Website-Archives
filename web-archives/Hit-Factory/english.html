It brings you a stereo sampler (with 8 to 30 tracks) with Direct To Disk possibilities, a stereo synthesizer (up to 10 channels of polyphony) and a stereo rhythms box (up to 10 channels of polyphony). Furthermore you can record everything you do, then reproduce (automation) or modify them.<BR>&nbsp;With this software, you will be able to create easily your own musics or remix the ones you like.<BR>&nbsp;Hit Factory is the perfect software for all thoses who like to create dance music, techno, trance, rap... and "LIVE" remixes. Thanks to its Direct To Disk capabilities, it can also be used as a multitracks audio numeric recorder for "rock" musicians.<BR><BR>Hit Factory is divided into five parts, each one using its own window:<UL TYPE=disc><LI>a sampler, which allows you to loop whatever sound you want or to read a file using Direct To Disk system. You can also modify the sound in real-time: reading speed (pitch), volume and panoramic or even add reverb.<LI>a synthesizer with which you can use twenty different sounds, which are turned into instruments. The synthesizer is directed from the keyboard.<LI>a rhythms box in which you can create up to twenty rhythms using ten instruments...<LI>a recorder which allows you to record your actions (i.e. your mixing) in order to create what is called a "music" and then reproduces it in an animated way with a precision of 1/100 of second: paddles move, buttons light on...<LI>an editor designed to modify your mixing.</UL><BR>&nbsp;Hit Factory requires a PowerMacintosh or compatible.  The computer must at least be running under System 7.1 and should have the Sound Manager 3.2 installed (included with QuickTime 2.5). You need a 14 inches monitor or more (15 is a lot better!).<BR>This program needs 900K of memory to run. The rest of the memory is used by the sounds. The more your sounds are big, the more you will have to increase the size of the memory allocated to Hit Factory.<BR>Hit Factory works with sound files of System 7 type or AIFF type (for Direct To Disk only). Theses sounds may be 8 or 16 bits, mono or stereo and even of whatever frequency: 11Khz, 22Khz, 44Khz...<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="2"><FONT COLOR="#000088">Ordering Hit Factory:</FONT></A></H2><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><BR>&nbsp;Hit Factory is sold <B>$U.S. 55</B> plus shipping.
