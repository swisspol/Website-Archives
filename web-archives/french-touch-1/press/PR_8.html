Well, we've been working the whole August month on the game and it's getting really close to release now and we took some time to setup a brand new QuickTime trailer in order to show you our progression. It's time to see this unique high-speed racing game in action!<BR>						<BR>						Remember our old WaterRace trailer from last year? Well, forget it and discover the new WaterRace. This trailer showcases the final WaterRace, which features redesigned ships, redesigned levels, redesigned 3D characters, improved music and more. It's a whole new game!<BR>						<BR>						Download the trailer from the WaterRace web site:<BR>						-&gt; <A href="http://www.waterrace.com">http://www.waterrace.com</A><BR>						<BR>						<BR>						You might wonder why we decided to redesign most of the game... well keep in mind we're not professional game developers and that we're working in our free time only on WaterRace. The consequence is that we learned a lot during the first year of development and we eventually realized that most of our first work was not as perfect as we wished, so we took the risk to start over on many features. And as this video proves, it worked out!<BR>						<BR>						To answer your upcoming question : we still cannot give you a more accurate release date than &quot;this fall&quot; since we're still in discussion with publishers and editors. But keep assured we're really doing our best in order that WaterRace is out ASAP.<BR>						<BR>						<BR>						We hope you'll enjoy this trailer - happy downloading !<BR>						<BR>						<BR>						Best regards,<BR>						<BR>						The French Touch Team</TT>					</UL>				</TD>			</TR>		</TABLE>		</B></TT></P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P><TT>Contact: Pierre-Olivier Latour<BR>		E-mail: <A href="mailto:info@french-touch.net">pol@french-touch.net</A></TT>	</BODY></HTML>
