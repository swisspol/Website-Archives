Did we encounter enormous problems developing the game, did we stop working?<BR>						<BR>						Today, we can say the answer is no: the French Touch team is definitely alive!<BR>						Actually, we had simply decided to isolate from the outside world in order to concentrate completely on our upcoming 3D game. We have been working very hard in the last few months on our upcoming title WaterRace. And now it's time to showcase the results:<BR>						<BR>						We have a new version of our home-made 3D engine: Infinity Engine V3. Even better graphic quality, visual FX, particle systems, improved animation system and more.<BR>						<BR>						We also redesigned the game WaterRace in order to get the best out of Infinity V3: redesigned ships, even nicer levels, awesome music, video FX, 3D animated characters and much, much more...<BR>						A bunch of new screenshots (including the ones from a previously unrevealed terrain: Scotland), boat descriptions and character profiles are already available on the freshly updated WaterRace web site:<BR>						<A href="http://www.waterrace.com">http://www.waterrace.com</A><BR>						<BR>						You will be amazed by the very special atmosphere and look they present!<BR>						<BR>						While you are online, don't forget to download a new exclusive set of desktop pictures based on the game. Give your Mac the look of one of the most original games of the year!<BR>						<A href="http://www.french-touch.net/desktop_pictures/">http://www.french-touch.net/desktop_pictures/</A><BR>						<BR>						Our _free_ 3D tools have been of course also updated: on top of importing QuickDraw3D 3DMF, Infinity Model Builder now supports DXF and OBJ format imports, has amazing built-in particle effects and the animation sequencer has been considerably improved.<BR>						<A href="http://www.french-touch.net/products.html">http://www.french-touch.net/products.htm</A><BR>						<BR>						Finally, next month we will unveil a brand new WaterRace level.
