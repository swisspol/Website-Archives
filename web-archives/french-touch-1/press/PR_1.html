						<tt><b>French Touch</b> is a newly created game company, born from the meeting on Internet of five French people : one programmer and four graphic designers, <b>French Touch</b> develops real-time 3D games on and for Power Macintosh. For this purpose, <b>French Touch</b> developed an exclusive 100% Rave 3D engine (Infinity) which is compatible with the ATI 3D chips of the latest Power Macs G3. <b>French Touch</b> also developed its own software such as Fusion for example, which is a unique 3D editing program entirely in real-time dedicated to the creation of the models for our games</tt> 
						<p><tt>More info is available on the web site : <a href="http://www.french-touch.net/fusion">http://www.french-touch.net/fusion</a>.</tt></p>
						<p><tt><b>French Touch</b> also wishes to create a new type of relationship between the players and the developers of the game, by on the one hand associating them actively with the development of the game (thanks to beta-testing), and on the other hand by placing at their free disposal on the web site the development tools used for the game such as model and terrain editors.</tt></p>
						<p><tt>The players will be able to easily create extensions or additional levels and we will of course put the best ones for download on the web site of the game.</tt></p>
						<p><tt>The games currently under development at <b>French Touch</b> are :</tt></p>
					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="6"><tt><b>WaterRace</b></tt></font></p>
					<ul>
						<p><tt>For its first realization, <b>French Touch</b> decided to choose a type of arcade game still unknown in the macintosh gaming world : boat races.</tt></p>
						<p><tt><b>WaterRace</b> is a racing game where the player will be able to face adversaries either simulated by the computer, or in network play over the Internet. <b>WaterRace</b> brings in addition many innovations to this concept : full 3D, open architecture of the game, many &quot;vehicles&quot; and animated terrains... <b>WaterRace</b> uses a special version of the 3D engine developed by <b>French Touch</b> which supports special effects like Soft Shadows, Lens Flares... The open architecture of the program will make it possible for the player to easily add extension packs: new boats, new terrains, new musics... which he will find on the Internet site of the game. But the player will also be able to create by himself extension packs thanks to the development tools created for the game, that <b>French Touch</b> will put for free download on the web site. Such features promise an almost unlimited lifetime for the game ! All the terrains will be different not only by their difficulty but also by their &quot;atmosphere&quot; so... special : lagoon, antartic, boat cemetery...</tt></p>
						<p><tt>Our goal : fun, speed, the satisfaction of the player, and of course to prove that it's possible to create very good original games for the Mac ! <b>WaterRace</b> will definitely mark the year 99 of the Mac game world. <b>WaterRace</b> will be distributed on Internet and will be sold as a shareware, most probably around $25 U.S. Release date : before summer 99.</tt></p>
						<p><tt>For further information relating to <b>WaterRace</b>, to get regularly updated screen shots as well as the lastest news, connect to the web site of the game : <a href="http://www.french-touch.net/waterrace">http://www.french-touch.net/waterrace</a></tt></p>
					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="6"><tt><b>Lords of Steel</b></tt></font></p>
					<ul>
						<p><tt>This game is our long time project.</tt></p>
						<p><tt>Unfortunately, we cannot diffuse yet much information on this game. All that we can say for the moment, is that, although it is based on the same 3D engine, <b>Lords of Steel</b> will be radically different from <b>WaterRace</b>. <b>Lords of Steel</b> is an adventure game with a complex script which takes place in a post-feudal futuristic universe where Mechs have replaced the knights. The sound track is considered as much important as the graphical part of the game and this will promise a total immersion of the player in the fantastic world of <b>Lords of Steel</b>. Due to the required storage, <b>Lords of Steel</b> is intended to be published on CD-Rom.</tt></p>
						<p><tt>No release date has been defined yet and further information will be available progressively with the advance of the game on the site : </tt><a href="http://www.french-touch.net/lords-of-steel"><tt>http://www.french-touch.net/lords-of-steel</tt></a></p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><tt>On the web site of <b>French Touch</b> (<a href="http://www.french-touch.net">http://www.french-touch.net</a>), you will be able to read the latest news, to learn more on our projects of games, but also to read a detailed summary of the history of the creation of <b>French Touch</b> and a profile of its members.</tt></p>
						<p><tt>A press room which includes high-resolution images of the games and logos (of a printable quality on paper magazines) and the texts of the press releases, is also accessible from the web site.</tt></p>
