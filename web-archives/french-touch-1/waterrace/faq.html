Everything you always wanted to know about the WaterRace game. The FAQ has been completely rewritten and now includes dozens of questions and their answers.<BR>							If you still have a question or a comment though, fell free to drop us an <A href="mailto:info@french-touch.net">e-mail</A>.<BR>							<BR>							</B><FONT color="#ff0029"><I>Last updated September 1st 2000</I></FONT></P>							<P>&nbsp;</P>						</DIV>						<UL>							<UL>								<HR>								<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">General :</FONT></P>								<P><B>1) When will WaterRace be out?</B></P>								<P>At any time between this September and Christmas... ;-)<BR>								Since the game is now very close to completion, it now depends on publishers and editors we are negotiating with.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>2) How will it be distributed?</B></P>								<P>At the beginning, we planned to distribute WaterRace as a shareware over the Internet. That's why we first designed the game so it could fit in a few Mb archive.<BR>								<BR>								Finally, the game is going to be much bigger than what we expected originally; and in order to preserve graphic and audio quality, <B>the game will be available on CD-Rom only and will be distributed as a commercial program.</B><BR>								<BR>								Publishers, editors, if interested to distribute this game, <A href="mailto:info@french-touch.net">contact us</A> rapidly.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>3) Are you planning a demo version?</B></P>								<P>Very likely, but only after the final version.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>4) Why is not the game out yet since the 3D engine is done and so are the tools?</B></P>								<P>We started working on the game in September 98. We hoped to release something in September 99, but since we had no experience in game development, we underestimated a lot the time required to develop the game. So in September 99, we showcased during the French Apple Expo, what we had at that point i.e. mostly a game engine and tools, not a real game. It showed people the serious and quality of our work and we got great feedback.<BR>								<BR>								It was actually naive to think we could do such a big game in a single year - especially if you consider that we are working in our spare time only and this is our first game.<BR>								<BR>								We know a lot of you are actively waiting for the game to be released. Fortunately, we are more experienced now and we have a very sure release date now - you just need to keep waiting a few more months :-)</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>5) The game is in beta for one year now. Why is this?</B></P>								<P>We do want to develop the best possible. One of the conditions was to include beta-testers in the development process way earlier than other game development teams, so we could work out the game all together and avoid last-minute problems. Actually, as soon as we had something working correctly, we set up the beta testers team and the game went &quot;beta&quot;. It's important to notice that this was possible because the game has always been very stable and almost never crashed.<BR>								<BR>								The testers are not only tracking bugs, but also working with us on the game design, on the gameplay and more...<BR>								</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>6) So when will it be in real beta state?</B></P>								<P>Well since the game has always been beta-tested, the good news is no beta testing phase will be needed before release; once all features are implemented it will just go final directly!</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>7) What features are still lacking?</B></P>								<P>Only one level and one ship are left to be designed and some IA code.<BR>								<BR>								<I>Be patient, it takes time to develop a good game! :-)</I></P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>8) Why are you not updating your web site more often?</B></P>								<P>The fact is that once again all French Touch team members are working in their spare time only on the game (usually after work, during the nights and the weekends :-) ).<BR>								So we just don't have an unlimited amount of hours, and we prefer spending most of them working on the game rather than updating the web site (it takes time too).<BR>								Sorry :-/</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>9) Do you like having some people telling its vaporware?</B></P>								<P>No we really don't. If you consider a product as vaporware because it is not out, then you have to consider many products and games as vaporware. So we're like others then.<BR>								Anyway, the point is we're working hours and hours to bring to the mac gamers a real unique mac game, the best possible game. We're working on the game after our main work, during the nights and during the week-ends: we just can't do more.<BR>								<BR>								Some people are very naive and just don't realize how long it takes to develop a game (between one and two years). It's a <B>HUGE</B> amount of work. Nobody can build a fairly complicated 3D game with as many features and their associated 3D tools in a year.<BR>								<BR>								Fortunately most people know what it's like working on a big project and show us their support, and we thank them for that.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>10) Wait a minute. Do you mean you're not professional game developers?</B></P>								<P>No, we're not professional game developers paid to work 8 hours per day on WaterRace: we're all doing it for free in our spare time - actually it even costs us money. All people in the French Touch team have a main job (graphic designer, student...) and are working on the game when they have some free time.<BR>								<BR>								Want to know more about us and discover the history of French Touch? Have a look at the <A href="http://www.french-touch.net/french.html" target="_top">team</A> page.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">								<HR>								Gameplay :</FONT></P>								<P><B>1) You said the physic engine was realistic; will there be a level of realism setting?</B></P>								<P>No because WaterRace is an arcade game, not a simulation. The physic engine is realistic but not to much: only enough not to make you think you're driving a car ;-)<BR>								Don't worry about that, you won't need a ship driving license: the game is targeted to all audience.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>2) Are there any ship damage e.g. like in Carmageddon?</B></P>								<P>No because such a feature does not fit with WaterRace type of game.<BR>								Your ship will not be deformed because of collisions, but of course hitting a wall at very high speed will have consequences like lossing the race for example.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>3) Is there any ship upgrading possibilities (e.g. changing the engine, modifying the rudder...)?</B></P>								<P>We thought about it, but finally there won't be any ship upgrading system for the following reasons:<BR>								&#149; WaterRace is an arcade racing game and not a simulation, so such a feature complicates a lot the gameplay for almost nothing,<BR>								&#149; you already have a kind of upgrading system in the game. When you have enough points, you get access to new ships. So it's even better since you're not updating only part of the ship, but changing the entire ship!<BR>								&#149; since we have a realistic physic engine, if people are allowed to do their own combination of motors, foils, hull shape, etc... : they will need strong physic knowledge in order not to end up with a ship that sinks immediately or is not drivable.<BR>								<BR>								The good news for people who like to get their hands dirty with physic parameter tuning is that they will still be able to customize them using the external tool <A href="http://www.french-touch.net/metafile_editor/" target="_top">Infinity MetaFile Editor</A> - provided with the game of course.<BR>								</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>4) Will there be any waves?</B></P>								<P>Yes and no. It means the 3D engine and physic engines do support the rendering of waves up to 1 meter high, but there won't be any levels using such high waves for two reasons:<BR>								&#149; WaterRace is an offshore racing game, not a wave racing game: the gameplay is built around speed and not around waves and jumps. Basically, you just can't have speed and waves: it's not compatible.<BR>								&#149; and furthermore, since this is a high-speed racing game, ships are not designed for waves: there are designed primary for speed. Most ships are simply not usable in waves.<BR>								<BR>								So all levels have a maximum wave height of roughly 30 cm (that's why you don't really notice them on the screenshots). It's surely not a lot, but trust us, at 150Km/h, it definitely has strong consequence on your ship behaviour!</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>5) Why is there no wake effect behind the boats?</B></P>								<P>Actually, there is a very nice one now :-)<BR>								You will see it the next time we update the gallery section of this web site.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>6) How many competitors is there in a race?</B></P>								<P>The game supports up to 8 players. However, to improve performances and gameplay, we're probably going to lower this number. But it will only affect single play, not network games.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>7) Will it support local network play?</B></P>								<P>Definitely and using TCP/IP only! You will be able to choose the location, ship, look of the ship (texture set)...</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>8) How many people can join a network game?</B></P>								<P>Up to eight.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>9) Will it support Internet play?</B></P>								<P>Unfortunately, the first release of WaterRace will not officially support Internet play (the networking code actually uses TCP/IP, so it will be &quot;usable&quot; over the Internet, but probably not &quot;playable&quot; because of the latency problems).<BR>								<BR>								Actually, having a racing game work correctly over the Internet in <B>extremely</B> difficult because of their very own specificities that you don't have in flight simulators, space combat games, quake-likes... that's probably why you don't have any racing game that works on the Internet right now (with a modem connection).<BR>								<BR>								If this is technically possible though, we'll do our best to provide a version of the game that works on the Internet later on (with Game Ranger support of course).</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">								<HR>								Extensibilty :</FONT></P>								<P><B>1) Will I be able to create my own ships completely from the ground?</B></P>								<P>Sure thanks to our easy-to-use 3D editing tool <A href="http://www.french-touch.net/model_builder/" target="_top">Infinity Model Builder</A> also provided with the game. You can simply create an original and personnal texture for your ship or build completely a new one.<BR>								It's exactly the same tool that the French Touch team is using to create all the 3D models of the game.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>2) How about creating levels then?</B></P>								<P>The answer is also yes! <A href="http://www.french-touch.net/terrain_builder/" target="_top">Infinity Terrain Builder</A> is the best 3D level editing tool for the Mac and it will be available with the game!</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>3) And new characters?</B></P>								<P>The answer is still yes! Even it will be much more difficult.<A href="../terrain_builder/" target="_top"><BR>								</A>WaterRace is the most open game ever made! ;-)</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">								<HR>								Technical stuff :</FONT></P>								<P><B>1) Is WaterRace multi-screen aware?</B></P>								<P>If you have a multiple screens configuration, you will be able to select on which screen you want to run the game.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>2) Does it mess up my icons on the desktop?</B></P>								<P>No!</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>3) Does it support Input Sprocket?</B></P>								<P>Yes. Actually it needs InputSprocket to run.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>4) Some people said this game used QuickDraw 3D, is this true?</B></P>								<P>Actually, not at all: WaterRace uses only Rave like most 3D games on the Mac. It is <B>not</B> a QuickDraw 3D game like Nanosaur or Bugdom.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>5) Will it support OpenGL?</B></P>								<P>The first release of WaterRace will be Rave only, and not be OpenGL compatible, because it runs better with Rave. We might release an OpenGL version for MacOS 9 later in the year though.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>6) Will it work on MacOS X?</B></P>								<P>The first release of WaterRace will be MacOS 8 and 9 only (maybe MacOS 7.5 and 7.6). But we're planning to release a MacOS X version of WaterRace later in the year.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">								<HR>								Performances and required configuration:</FONT></P>								<P><B>1) What are the current performances of the game ?</B></P>								<P>The current version of WaterRace, which is <B>still unoptimized,</B> runs between 25 and 130FPS on a Yosemite G3 350Mhz with an ATI Rage 128 in maximum quality:<BR>								&#149; 1024x768 rendering,<BR>								&#149; 32 Bits Z-Buffer<BR>								&#149; millions of colors rendering<BR>								&#149; texture filtering<BR>								&#149; full visual FX and music</P>								<P>On a PowerBook G3 250Mhz with an ATI Rage II (like first generation iMacs), the game runs around 15FPS:<BR>								&#149; 600x400 rendering,<BR>								&#149; 16 Bits Z-Buffer<BR>								&#149; thousands of colors rendering<BR>								&#149; some visual FX and music</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>2) What is the required configuration to run WaterRace?</B></P>								<P>Any G3 computer or PowerMacintosh PCI with Rave compliant 3D acceleration and more than 2Mb of Video Memory (VRAM).<BR>								This includes of course current iMacs, PowerBooks and G4 computers but also the first generation iMac and all G3 based computers.</P>								<P>&nbsp;</P>								<P><B>3) Which 3D accelerators card does WaterRace support?</B></P>								<P>WaterRace should support any Rave compliant 3D accelerator.<BR>								<BR>								Practicly, <B>all</B> ATI cards are officialy supported (Rage II, Rage Pro, Rage 128, Radeon...) and also most 3Dfx cards (Voodoo 2000, Voodoo 3000, Voodoo 4000 and 5000).<BR>								<B><BR>								We are actually working very closely with the driver engineers of both 3Dfx and ATI to make sure the game runs perfectly.</B></P>								<P>&nbsp;							</UL>						</UL>					</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD><FONT color="black">1</FONT>						<P><FONT color="black">1</FONT></TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD>						<CENTER>							<IMG height="22" width="31" src="imag/b1.gif"><A href="movie.html" target="contenant" onmouseover="bas_display(1);self.status = 'Previous page'; return true " onmouseout="bas_display(0)"><IMG src="imag/b2a.gif" width="20" height="22" border="0"></A><IMG height="22" width="408" src="imag/b3.gif"><A href="main.html" onmouseover="bas_display(3);self.status = 'Next page'; return true " onmouseout="bas_display(2)"><IMG src="imag/b4a.gif" width="20" height="22" border="0"></A><IMG height="22" width="29" src="imag/b5.gif"></CENTER>						<P><FONT color="black">1</FONT></P>						<P><FONT color="black">1</FONT></TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>		</DIV>	</BODY></HTML>
