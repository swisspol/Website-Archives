						<P>WaterRace is the first boat racing game available on the Power Mac plateform.</P>
						<P>The players will be able to face adversaries either simulated by the computer, or in network play over the Internet.<BR>
						</P>
						<P>WaterRace brings in addition many innovations to this concept: full 3D, open architecture of the game, many &quot;vehicles&quot; and animated terrains...<BR>
						</P>
						<P>WaterRace uses a special version of the 3D engine developed by French Touch which supports special effects like Soft Shadows, Lens Flares...<BR>
						</P>
						<P>The open architecture of the program will make it possible for the player to easily add extension packs: new boats, new terrains, new musics... which will be available on this web site. But the player will also be able to create by himself extension packs thanks to the development tools created for the game, that will also be available for free on this web site!</P>
						<P>All the terrains will be different not only by their difficulty but also by their &quot;atmosphere&quot; so... special: lagoon, antartic, boat cemetery...<BR>
						</P>
						<P>Such features promise an almost unlimited lifetime for the game!<BR>
						</P>
						<P>&nbsp;</P>
						<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">Features</FONT></P>
						<P>It's the first game completely designed for Apple's new G3 computers. This means:</P>
						<UL>
							<LI>exclusive 100% Rave 3D engine (<A href="http://www.french-touch.net/infinity/index.html">Infinity</A>) that communicates directly with the ATI or 3Dfx 3D chips for awesom performances
							<LI>high resolution 3D models
							<LI>interface and game in thousands of colors
							<LI>visual effects like lens flare and soft shadows
							<LI>CD quality sound effects and musics
						</UL>
						<P>WaterRace will also support network games over Local Area Network and maybe over the Internet.</P>
						<P>&nbsp;</P>
						<P><FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">Software and hardware requirements</FONT></P>
						<P>WaterRace runs virtually on any PowerMac as does Infinity but it is &quot;playable&quot; only on PowerMacs with hardware acceleration (see the Infinity page for more information about this).</P>
						<P>&nbsp;</P>
						<P>&nbsp;<FONT color="#ffaa00" size="5">The testers say</FONT></P>
						<P>WaterRace DR6 was sent to a bunch of selected beta-testers.<BR>
						Even if it was a really early beta, feedback was really good: &quot;Great interface design&quot;, &quot;GREAT music&quot;, &quot;Overall WaterRace rocks!&quot;...</P>
